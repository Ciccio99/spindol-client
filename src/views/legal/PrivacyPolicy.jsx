            Thank you for visiting SleepWell! We offer personalized sleep coaching services to enable you to track the quality of your sleep. Because we feel that data does not get much more personal than this, we are committed to protecting your personal data through our compliance with this Privacy Policy. We hope that you will take a moment to review the information below.

            1. ABOUT THIS POLICY

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how Moonshot Brewing Holdings, Inc (“SleepWell,” “we,” “us,” and/or “our”) handles the personal data we collect from and about you when you use our products and services, including our mobile application, the SleepWell Sleep Coaching service, and the sleepwell.ai website (collectively, “Services”). It also describes certain legal rights you may have, subject to applicable law, and how you may exercise them.
            For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal data” means information about an identified or identifiable individual, such as their name or email address. Some `meet this definition.

            In most cases, under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), SleepWell is considered the “data controller” of the personal data that we handle under this Privacy Policy, though we may handle personal data as a “data processor” in some circumstances.

            Please note that certain measurement data collected via the Services may be regarded as health-related data under data protection laws in certain jurisdictions.
            By accessing or otherwise using our Services, you confirm that you have agreed to the  SleepWell Terms of Use and to SleepWell’s collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, where such agreement is permitted by applicable law.
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, we recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of our practices. We will not make substantial changes without providing prior notice. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” date at the top of this page.

            For data collected and stored by any third-party tracker, please refer to their privacy policies.

          </Typography>

            Information we collect directly
            We collect information that you choose to provide to us when you register an account on the app or through your use of the app, including but not limited to your: email address; gender; birthdate and birth year; height and weight; activities; and notes and tags. We may also collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you email us a question, sign up to receive our newsletter, submit a comment in response to one of our social media posts, and submit an employment or other application.

            We may also collect certain information automatically through the sleep and fitness tracking devices used for SleepWell Sleep Coaching, including but not limited to the following measurement data: heart rate; movement data; and temperature data.
            Based on your voluntarily provided data and automatically collected measurement data, we calculate a variety of parameters, such as: duration of sleep; sleep phases (deep, light, REM, awake); activity levels throughout the day; and body mass index (calculated based on height and weight). This information is used to produce evaluation data regarding the quality of your sleep, level of your recovery, and balance of your activity.
            In addition, when you visit our website, use our mobile app, and interact with e-mails that we send to you, we passively collect information from you, including your internet protocol address (“IP address”), browser type, operating system, device identifier, device model, software version, or mobile or ISP carrier information. We also use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect information about your visit to our website, such as the date and time of your visit, the information you searched to find the website, or your activity on the website. “Cookies” are small text files that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them or after a specified expiration date) to understand more about your use of our website.

              Legal Bases for Processing.
            </Typography>
            The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose your personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds are as follows:
            Legitimate interest
            In most cases, we handle personal data on the ground that it furthers our legitimate interests in commercial activities, such as the following, in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:

              Legal compliance
            </Typography>
            We need to use and disclose personal data in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
            To honor our contractual commitments to an individual
            Some of our processing of personal data is to meet our contractual obligations to the individual to whom the personal data pertains.
            Consent
            Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of implied or express consent. Measurement data or any data derived from measurement data is used for advertising only subject to your explicit consent.
